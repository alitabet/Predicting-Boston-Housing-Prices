# Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices

Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Project 1 on Predicting Boston Housing Prices 

The aim of this project is to implement the ideas in Machine Learning related to model evaluation and validation. It is Project 1 in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. More specifically, we will use data related to housing prices in Boston in order to predict the best house price for a sample house.

The main code is in file boston_housing.py. Alternatively, there is a Python Notebook implementation with the code and further comments on the results (Predicting Boston Housing Prices.ipynb). Finally, a PDF version of the code and answers to the project questions are in Predicting Boston Housing Prices.pdf.
